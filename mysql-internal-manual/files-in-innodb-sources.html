<h1 class="title"><a name="files-in-innodb-sources"></a>Appendix B InnoDB Source Code Distribution</h1>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
    The <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> source files are the best place to
    look for information about internals of the file structure that
    MySQLers can optionally use for transaction support. But when you
    first look at all the subdirectories and file names you'll wonder:
    Where Do I Start? It can be daunting.
  </p><p>
    Well, I've been through that phase, so I'll pass on what I had to
    learn on the first day that I looked at <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>
    source files. I am very sure that this will help you grasp, in
    overview, the organization of <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> modules. I'm
    also going to add comments about what is going on -- which you
    should mistrust! These comments are reasonable working hypotheses;
    nevertheless, they have not been subjected to expert peer review.
  </p><p>
    Here's how I'm going to organize the discussion. I'll take each of
    the 31 <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> subdirectories that come with the
    MySQL 5.0 source code in <code class="filename">\innobase</code> (on my
    Windows directory). The format of each section will be like this
    every time:
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\subdirectory-name (LONGER EXPLANATORY
    NAME)</strong></span>
</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td scope="row"><span class="bold"><strong>File Name</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>What Name Stands For</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>Size</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>Comment Inside File</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">file-name</td><td>my-own-guess</td><td>in-bytes</td><td>from-the-file-itself</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
<p>
    ... My-Comments
  </p><p>
    For example:
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
"<span class="bold"><strong>\ha (HASHING)</strong></span>
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  ha0ha.c     Hashing/Hashing        8,145   Hash table with external chains

  Comments about hashing will be here.
"
</pre><p>
    The "Comment Inside File" column is a direct copy from the first /*
    comment */ line inside the file. All other comments are mine. After
    I've discussed each directory, I'll finish with some notes about
    naming conventions and a short list of URLs that you can use for
    further reference.
  </p><p>
    Now let's begin.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\btr (B-TREE)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For         Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------         ------   -------------------
  btr0btr.c   B-tree / B-tree              82,400   B-tree
  btr0cur.c   B-tree / Cursor             103,233   index tree cursor
  btr0sea.c   B-tree / Search              41,788   index tree adaptive search
  btr0pcur.c  B-tree / persistent cursor   16,720   index tree persistent cursor
</pre><p>
    If you total up the sizes of the C files, you'll see that \btr is
    the second-largest file group in InnoDB. This is understandable
    because maintaining a B-tree is a relatively complex task. Luckily,
    there has been a lot of work done to describe efficient management
    of B-tree and B+-tree structures, much of it open-source or
    public-domain, since their original invention over thirty years ago.
  </p><p>
    <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> likes to put everything in B-trees. This
    is what I'd call a "distinguishing characteristic" because in all
    the major DBMSs (like IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle),
    the main or default or classic structure is the heap-and-index. In
    InnoDB the main structure is just the index. To put it another way:
    InnoDB keeps the rows in the leaf node of the index, rather than in
    a separate file. Compare Oracle's Index Organized Tables, and
    Microsoft SQL Server's Clustered Indexes.
  </p><p>
    This, by the way, has some consequences. For example, you may as
    well have a primary key since otherwise InnoDB will make one anyway.
    And that primary key should be the shortest of the candidate keys,
    since <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> will use it as a pointer if there
    are secondary indexes.
  </p><p>
    Most importantly, it means that rows have no fixed address.
    Therefore the routines for managing file pages should be good. We'll
    see about that when we look at the \row (ROW) program group later.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\buf (BUFFERING)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  buf0buf.c   Buffering / Buffering 65,582   The database buffer buf_pool
  buf0flu.c   Buffering / Flush     29,583   ... flush algorithm
  buf0lru.c   / least-recently-used 27,515   ... replacement algorithm
  buf0rea.c   Buffering / read      21,504   ... read
</pre><p>
    There is a separate file group (\mem MEMORY) which handles memory
    requests in general. A "buffer" usually has a more specific
    definition, as a memory area which contains copies of pages that
    ordinarily are in the main data file. The "buffer pool" is the set
    of all buffers (there are lots of them because InnoDB doesn't depend
    on the operating system's caching to make things faster).
  </p><p>
    The pool size is fixed (at the time of this writing) but the rest of
    the buffering architecture is sophisticated, involving a host of
    control structures. In general: when InnoDB needs to access a new
    page it looks first in the buffer pool; InnoDB reads from disk to a
    new buffer when the page isn't there; InnoDB chucks old buffers
    (basing its decision on a conventional Least-Recently-Used
    algorithm) when it has to make space for a new buffer.
  </p><p>
    There are routines for checking a page's validity, and for
    read-ahead. An example of "read-ahead" use: if a sequential scan is
    going on, then a DBMS can read more than one page at a time, which
    is efficient because reading 32,768 bytes (two pages) takes less
    than twice as long as reading 16,384 bytes (one page).
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\data (DATA)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  data0data.c Data / Data           15,344   SQL data field and tuple
  data0type.c Data / Type            7,417   Data types
</pre><p>
    This is a collection of minor utility routines affecting rows.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\db (DATABASE)</strong></span>
  </p><p>
    There are no .c files in \db, just one .h file with some definitions
    for error codes.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\dict (DICTIONARY)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  dict0dict.c Dictionary / Dictionary 114,263 Data dictionary system
  dict0boot.c Dictionary / boot     11,704   ... booting

  dict0load.c Dictionary / load     34,049   ... load to memory cache
  dict0mem.c  Dictionary / memory    7,470   ... memory object creation
</pre><p>
    The data dictionary (known in some circles as the catalog) has the
    metadata information about objects in the database --- column sizes,
    table names, and the like.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\dyn (DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED ARRAY)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  dyn0dyn.c   Dynamic / Dynamic        994   dynamically allocated array
</pre><p>
    There is a single function in the dyn0dyn.c program, for adding a
    block to the dynamically allocated array. InnoDB might use the array
    for managing concurrency between threads.
  </p><p>
    At the moment, the \dyn program group is trivial.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\eval (EVALUATING)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size    Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------  -------------------
  eval0eval.c Evaluating/Evaluating 17,061  SQL evaluator
  eval0proc.c Evaluating/Procedures  5,001  Executes SQL procedures
</pre><p>
    The evaluating step is a late part of the process of interpreting an
    SQL statement --- parsing has already occurred during \pars
    (PARSING).
  </p><p>
    The ability to execute SQL stored procedures is an InnoDB feature,
    but MySQL handles stored procedures in its own way, so the
    eval0proc.c program is unimportant.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\fil (FILE)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  fil0fil.c   File / File          118,312   The low-level file system
</pre><p>
    The reads and writes to the database files happen here, in
    coordination with the low-level file i/o routines (see os0file.c in
    the \os program group).
  </p><p>
    Briefly: a table's contents are in pages, which are in files, which
    are in tablespaces. Files do not grow; instead one can add new files
    to the tablespace. As we saw earlier (discussing the \btr program
    group) the pages are nodes of B-trees. Since that's the case, new
    additions can happen at various places in the logical file
    structure, not necessarily at the end. Reads and writes are
    asynchronous, and go into buffers, which are set up by routines in
    the \buf program group.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>\fsp (FILE SPACE)</strong></span>
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  File Name   What Name Stands For  Size     Comment Inside File
  ---------   --------------------  ------   -------------------
  fsp0fsp.c   File Space Management 110,495  File space management
</pre><p>
    I would have thought that the \fil (FILE) and \fsp (FILE SPACE)
    MANAGEMENT programs would fit together in the same program group;
    however, I guess the InnoDB folk are splitters rather than lumpers.
  </p><p>
    It's in fsp0fsp.c that one finds some of the descriptions and
    comments of extents, segments, and headers. For example, the
    "descriptor bitmap of the pages in the extent" is in here, and you
    can find as well how the free-page list is maintained, what's in the
    bitmaps, and what various header fields' contents are.

    When a "database" is so small that InnoDB can load it all into

    If you've used DB2 or SQL Server, you might think that locks have
    their own in-memory table, that row locks might need occasional
    escalation to table locks, and that there are three lock types:
    Shared, Update, Exclusive.
  </p><p>
    All those things are untrue with <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>! Locks
    are kept in the database pages. A bunch of row locks can't be rolled
    together into a single table lock. And most importantly there's only
    one lock type. I call this type "Update" because it has the
    characteristics of DB2 / SQL Server Update locks, that is, it blocks
    other updates but doesn't block reads. Unfortunately,
    <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> comments refer to them as "x-locks" etc.
  </p><p>
    To sum it up: if your background is Oracle you won't find too much
    surprising, but if your background is DB2 or SQL Server the locking
    concepts and terminology will probably confuse you at first.

    Oracle-style and DB2/SQL-Server-style locks at:

    Rows can be selected, inserted, updated/deleted, or purged (a

    Speaking of MySQL, notice that one of the larger programs in the

    and MySQL" (row0mysql.c) --- information interchange happens at this
    level because rows in InnoDB and in MySQL are analogous, something

    <span class="bold"><strong>Some Notes About Structures</strong></span>
  </p><p>
    InnoDB's job, as a storage engine for MySQL, is to provide:
    commit-rollback, crash recovery, row-level locking, and consistent
    non-blocking reads. How? With locks, a paged-file structure with
    buffer pooling, and undo/redo logs,
  </p><p>
    The locks are kept in bit maps in main memory. Thus InnoDB differs
    from Oracle in one respect: instead of storing lock information on
    the page as Oracle does with Interested Transaction Lists, InnoDB
    keeps it in a separate and more volatile structure. But both Oracle
    and InnoDB try to achieve a similar goal: "writers don't block
    readers". So a typical InnoDB row-read involves: (a) if the reading
    is for writing, then check if the row is locked and if so wait; (b)
    if according to the information in the row header the row has been
    changed by some newer transaction, then get the older version from
    the log. We call the (b) part "versioning" because it means that a
    reader can get the older version of a row and thus will have a
    temporally consistent view of all rows.
  </p><p>
    The InnoDB workspace consists of: tablespace and log files. A
    tablespace consists of: segments, as many as necessary. A segment is
    usually a file, but might be a raw disk partition. A segment
    consists of: extents. An extent consists of: 64 pages. A page's
    length is always 16KB, for both data and index. A page consists of:
    a page header, and some rows. The page and row formats are the
    subjects of later chapters.
  </p><p>
    InnoDB keeps two logs, the redo log and the undo log.
  </p><p>
    The redo log is for re-doing data changes that had not been written
    to disk when a crash occurred. There is one redo log for the entire
    workspace, it contains multiple files (the number depends on
    innodb_log_files_in_group), it is circular (that is, after writing
    to the last file InnoDB starts again on the first file). The file
    header includes the last successful checkpoint. A redo log record's
    contents are: Page Number (4 bytes = page number within tablespace),
    Offset of change within page (2 bytes), Log Record Type (insert,
    update, delete, "fill space with blanks", etc.), and the changes on
    that page (only redo values, not old values).
  </p><p>
    The undo log is primarily for removing data changes that had been
    written to disk when a crash occurred, but should not have been
    written, because they were for uncommitted transactions. Sometimes
    InnoDB calls the undo log the "rollback segment". The undo log is
    inside the tablespace. The "insert" section of the undo log is
    needed only for transaction rollback and can be discarded at COMMIT
    time. The "update/delete" section of the undo log is also useful for
    consistent reads, and can be discarded when InnoDB has ended all
    transactions that might need the undo log records to reconstruct
    earlier versions of rows. An undo log record's contents are: Primary
    Key Value (not a page number or physical address), Old Transaction
    ID (of the transaction that updated the row), and the changes (only
    old values).
  </p><p>
    COMMIT will write the contents of the log buffer to disk, and put
    undo log records in a history list. ROLLBACK will delete undo log
    records that are no longer needed. PURGE (an internal operation that
    occurs outside user control) will no-longer-necessary undo log
    records and, for data records that have been marked for deletion and
    are no longer necessary for consistent read, will remove the
    records. CHECKPOINT causes -- well, see the article "How Logs Work
    On MySQL With InnoDB Tables".

    <span class="bold"><strong>A Note About File Naming</strong></span>
  </p><p>
    There appears to be a naming convention. The first letters of the
    file name are the same as the subdirectory name, then there is a '0'
    separator, then there is an individual name. For the main program in
    a subdirectory, the individual name may be a repeat of the
    subdirectory name. For example, there is a file named ha0ha.c (the
    first two letters ha mean "it's in subdirectory ..\ha", the next
    letter 0 means "0 separator", the next two letters mean "this is the
    main ha program"). This naming convention is not strict, though: for
    example the file lexyy.c is in the \pars subdirectory.
  </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>A Note About Copyrights</strong></span>
  </p><p>
    Most of the files begin with a copyright notice or a creation date,
    for example "Created 10/25/1995 Heikki Tuuri". I don't know a great
    deal about the history of <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>, but found it
    interesting that most creation dates were between 1994 and 1998.
