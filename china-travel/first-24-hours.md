# First 24 Hours in China

This guide helps first-time foreign visitors survive their first 24 hours in China **without relying on tour guides or local contacts**.

This is not about sightseeing.  
This is about **staying functional**.

If something goes wrong in the first day, the rest of the trip becomes much harder.

If that sounds like you, keep reading.

## The First 24 Hours: What Usually Goes Wrong

Most first-time visitors fail in the same places:

- No internet → nothing else works
- Payment fails → can’t buy food or transport
- Transport confusion → stress and overpaying
- ID / real-name rules appear suddenly
- Fear of “doing something wrong”

This guide is structured to prevent those failures.

---

## Priority Order (Do Not Skip)

**Do things in this order.**  
Skipping steps increases the chance of failure.

1. Get internet access
2. Secure basic transportation
3. Make sure you can pay
4. Understand ID & real-name rules
5. Complete your first purchase

---

## 1. Get Internet Access (Highest Priority)

### Why This Matters
Without internet:
- Maps don’t work
- Payment apps don’t work
- Translation doesn’t work

You will feel stuck very quickly.

---

### Safest Option

**Option A: eSIM or SIM at the airport**

Do this **before leaving the arrival area**.

What to look for:
- eSIM or SIM that works immediately
- Data-only is fine
- No real-name registration required for foreigners

---

### If That Fails (Fallback)

- Airport Wi-Fi (temporary)
- Hotel Wi-Fi (only if you are going directly there)

⚠️ Do not assume you can “figure it out later”.  
Internet is the foundation for everything else.

---

## 2. Get From Airport to the City

### Safest Options (In Order)

1. **Official airport taxi**
   - Follow signs inside the terminal
   - Avoid anyone approaching you

2. **Airport metro / express train**
   - Cheapest
   - Requires basic navigation

---

### What to Avoid

- Unofficial drivers offering rides
- “Special price for you” offers
- Anyone asking you to follow them

If unsure, **stop and go back inside the terminal**.

---

## 3. Make Sure You Can Pay

### Reality Check

In most cities:
- Cash is often not accepted
- Cards are unreliable
- Mobile payment is standard

---

### Best Option

**WeChat Pay or Alipay (International Version)**

What usually works:
- Link a foreign credit card
- Passport verification

⚠️ Setup may take time. Do this as early as possible.

---

### Fallback Options

- Airport shops (more likely to accept cards)
- Hotel front desk assistance
- Carry small cash, but don’t rely on it

If you cannot pay, your mobility drops sharply.

---

## 4. Understand ID & Real-Name Rules

### This Will Surprise You

In China, many services require:
- Real-name verification
- Passport checks

This is normal, not personal.

---

### Common Situations

- Buying train tickets
- Entering some attractions
- Hotel check-in
- Some apps or services

Always carry your **passport**, not a photo.

---

## 5. Complete Your First Purchase

### Why This Matters

Your first successful purchase:
- Reduces anxiety
- Confirms your setup works
- Builds confidence

---

### Best First Purchase

- Bottled water
- Snack
- Metro ticket

Use this as a test:
- Payment works
- Staff interaction
- Price clarity

If something fails here, fix it now — not later.

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Stop. Don’t Panic.

Most problems are **system friction**, not personal failure.

General fallback rules:
- Go back to official locations (airport, metro station, hotel)
- Ask for written prices
- Use translation apps
- Avoid rushing decisions

---

## Final Reminder

You don’t need to understand everything.

You only need to:
- Stay connected
- Stay mobile
- Stay calm

Once the first 24 hours pass, things get easier.

After this guide:
- Each section is expanded into its own survival scenario
- More detailed step-by-step instructions are provided

If you survived Day One, you’re doing fine.
